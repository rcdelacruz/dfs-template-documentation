# Detailed Functional Specification Documentation

This repository contains a comprehensive guide and template for creating Detailed Functional Specifications (DFS) for software development projects, with a particular focus on outsourcing scenarios.

## Overview

A Detailed Functional Specification (DFS) is a comprehensive document that describes both what a system should do (functional requirements) and how it should be implemented (technical specifications). It serves as a bridge between business requirements and technical implementation.

This documentation is built using MkDocs with the Material theme and includes:

1. **DFS Guide**: General information about DFS documents, when to use them, and how to customize them
2. **Template**: A complete, section-by-section breakdown of the DFS template with guidance
3. **Example**: A sample DFS for a full-stack e-commerce application using NestJS and NextJS
