# Functional Specifications

This section provides guidance on documenting the functional specifications of a system, including user stories, feature specifications, user interface designs, and API specifications.

## User Stories / Use Cases

User stories and use cases describe how users interact with the system to accomplish specific goals. They provide a detailed view of system behavior from the user's perspective.

### User Story Format

User stories typically follow this format:

```
As a [user type],
I want to [perform some action]
So that [achieve some goal or benefit]
```

Example:
```
As a customer,
I want to add products to my shopping cart
So that I can purchase multiple items at once
```

### Use Case Format

For more complex interactions, use cases provide a more structured format:

```
Use Case: [Name]
Actor: [Primary user]
Preconditions: [What must be true before the use case begins]
Basic Flow:
1. [Step-by-step description of the main scenario]
2. ...
Alternative Flows:
- [Description of variations or exceptions]
Postconditions: [What must be true after the use case completes]
```

Example:

```
Use Case: Add Product to Cart
Actor: Customer
Preconditions: Customer is viewing a product detail page

Basic Flow:
1. Customer selects product variant (if applicable)
2. Customer adjusts quantity
3. Customer clicks "Add to Cart" button
4. System adds item to cart
5. System displays cart confirmation with subtotal and cart link

Alternative Flows:
- If product has required options, system prompts for selection
- If stock is insufficient, system displays error message

Postconditions: Product is added to customer's cart
```

### Organizing User Stories

Group user stories by feature area or user type:

```markdown
## Customer User Stories
- As a customer, I want to browse products by category
- As a customer, I want to search for products by keyword
- As a customer, I want to add products to my cart

## Admin User Stories
- As an admin, I want to manage product inventory
- As an admin, I want to view order details
- As an admin, I want to process refunds
```

## Feature Specifications

Feature specifications provide detailed descriptions of system features, including acceptance criteria and business rules.

### Feature Specification Format

```markdown
Feature: [Feature Name]

Description:
[Detailed description of the feature]

User Acceptance Criteria:
- [Specific criteria that must be met for the feature to be accepted]
- ...

Business Rules:
- [Rules specific to this feature]
- ...

Dependencies:
- [Other features or systems this feature depends on]
- ...
```

Example:

```markdown
Feature: Shopping Cart

Description:
The shopping cart enables customers to collect items for purchase, adjust quantities, apply discounts, and proceed to checkout.

User Acceptance Criteria:
- Cart persists between sessions for logged-in users
- Cart persists for 30 days for anonymous users via browser storage
- Users can add, remove, and update quantities of items
- Cart displays subtotal, tax, and total amounts
- Cart validates product availability before checkout

Business Rules:
- BR-001: Maximum 50 items allowed in a cart
- BR-002: Quantity per item limited to available stock
- BR-003: Discounts cannot reduce an item's price below minimum margin
- BR-004: Tax calculation based on shipping destination

```

### Prioritizing Features

Include prioritization information to guide development:

```markdown

  description: String!
  price: Float!
  images: [ProductImage!]!
  category: Category
  variants: [ProductVariant!]!
  stockQuantity: Int!
  rating: Float
  reviewCount: Int
}

type Query {
  products(
    page: Int = 1
    limit: Int = 20
    categoryId: ID
    search: String
    minPrice: Float
    maxPrice: Float
    sort: ProductSortInput
  ): ProductConnection!
  
  product(id: ID!): Product
}

# Additional type definitions
```

Example Queries:
```graphql
# Get paginated products
query GetProducts($page: Int, $limit: Int, $categoryId: ID) {
  products(page: $page, limit: $limit, categoryId: $categoryId) {
    items {
      id
      name
      price
      images {
        url
      }
    }
    meta {
      currentPage
      totalPages
    }
  }
}
```
```

### External API Integration

Document integration with external APIs:

```markdown
## External API Integration

### Payment Processor API (Stripe)

- Purpose: Process customer payments
- Documentation: [Link to Stripe API docs]
- Authentication: API key in header
- Endpoints Used:
  - POST /v1/payment_intents
  - POST /v1/refunds
- Implementation Notes:
  - Use webhooks for asynchronous payment confirmations
  - Store payment intent IDs with orders for reference
```

## Business Rules

Business rules define specific constraints, calculations, or behaviors that the system must implement.

```markdown
## Business Rules

### BR-001: Product Pricing
- Base price set at product level
- Variant-specific pricing overrides base price
- Special pricing (sales, promotions) takes priority over base and variant pricing
- Prices must include applicable taxes for display

### BR-002: Inventory Management
- Inventory tracked at variant level
- Orders reduce inventory only after payment confirmation
- Low stock threshold triggers alerts at 5 items remaining
- Out-of-stock products remain visible but cannot be purchased

### BR-003: User Authorization
- Admin role can access all functions
- Manager role can manage products and orders but not users
- Customer role can only access their own data
- Guest users can browse products and make purchases without an account
```

## Integration Requirements

```

By including detailed functional specifications, you provide clear guidance to development teams on what to build and how it should behave, ensuring that the implementation matches the intended design.
