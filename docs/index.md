# Detailed Functional Specification (DFS) Guide

## Purpose of This Documentation

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive guide to creating Detailed Functional Specifications (DFS) for software development projects, with a particular focus on outsourcing scenarios. A well-crafted DFS is essential for successful knowledge transfer, maintenance, and development handover.

## What is a Detailed Functional Specification?

A Detailed Functional Specification (DFS) is a comprehensive document that describes both what a system should do (functional requirements) and how it should be implemented (technical specifications). It serves as a bridge between business requirements and technical implementation, providing clear guidance to development teams.

In outsourcing contexts, the DFS is particularly important as it:

1. Provides a single source of truth for development teams
2. Facilitates knowledge transfer between different teams
3. Supports maintenance and future enhancements
4. Serves as documentation for client deliverables
5. Establishes clear expectations for all stakeholders

## How to Use This Guide

This documentation is organized into three main sections:

1. **DFS Guide**: General information about DFS documents, when to use them, and how to customize them
2. **Template**: A complete, section-by-section breakdown of the DFS template with guidance
3. **Example**: A sample DFS for a full-stack e-commerce application using NestJS and NextJS

You can use the navigation menu to explore specific sections, or follow the guide sequentially for a complete understanding of how to create effective DFS documents.

## Getting Started

To get started with creating your own Detailed Functional Specification:

1. Review the [Template Structure](guide/template-structure.md) to understand the components
2. Examine the [E-Commerce Example](example/overview.md) to see how a complete DFS looks
3. Adapt the template to your specific project needs using the [Customization](guide/customization.md) guide

## When to Create a DFS

A Detailed Functional Specification is most valuable in the following scenarios:

- Complex software development projects
- Projects involving multiple development teams
- Outsourced development where knowledge transfer is critical
- Systems that will require long-term maintenance
- Projects with clear handover requirements

For guidance on when a DFS is appropriate for your project, see [When to Use](guide/when-to-use.md).
